## Description
**Stop stressing about when to buy. Start planning with confidence.**

Budgie is the ultimate financial companion for students and freelancers with sporadic income. Unlike traditional budgeting apps that just track what you spent, Budgie helps you figure out **when** you can afford to spend.

**Why Budgie?**
Living on a student budget or irregular paychecks makes planning big purchases—like a new laptop, concert tickets, or a trip—incredibly stressful. You never know if spending today will leave you short for rent next month. Budgie solves this by projecting your future balance based on your unique income schedule and expenses.

**Key Features:**

📅 **Smart Purchase Scheduling**
Simply add items to your Wish List, set a "Purchase By" date, and let Budgie's algorithm find the *optimal* day to buy. It ensures you never dip below your safety net.

📈 **Visual Timeline**
See your financial future at a glance. Our interactive graph shows your projected balance for the next 6 months, highlighting exactly when money comes in and when it's safe to spend.

💰 **Sporadic Income Support**
Perfect for those who don't get a steady bi-weekly paycheck. Add one-off gigs, semester grants, or irregular shifts with ease.

🛡️ **Rain Check Mode**
Set a minimum "Rain Check" balance (e.g., $500). Budgie will never recommend a purchase that drops you below this safety net, giving you peace of mind.

🏠 **Home Screen Widget**
Keep an eye on your upcoming purchases and daily balance right from your home screen.

**Who is this for?**
- College Students
- Freelancers & Gig Workers
- Anyone with irregular income
- Anyone saving for specific goals while managing tight cash flow

Take control of your financial timeline. Download Budgie today and spend with confidence!
